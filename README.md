TEXT MINING JUZ IN AL QURAN WITH R SHINY
----------------------------------------
Abstract :
Al-Quran is the holy book of Muslims (Muslims) and a revelation from Allah SWT that was revealed to the Prophet Muhammad. With the increasing technological developments, the need to provide fast and precise information is the main focus of this research by utilizing text mining technology. Text mining in the Al-Quran is a part of data mining that can process a very large amount of knowledge data in the Al-Quran. The goal is to be able to find important information in a document (Al-Quran), and to find a relationship between one document and another using R. Studio, then apply it to the web App using R Shiny. The results of the experiments carried out resulted in the output of the Qur'anic text including: Information data and ranking suras in the Koran as well as translations of verses of the Koran; Most Frequent Words, the word منْ is the word that occurs most often; On the other hand كَانَ and به were the least likely to occur; In WordCloud the word منْ is the word that occurs most frequently. Meanwhile, in the translation the word 'which' appears the most; and Letter indicates that the letter that often appears for each juz is alif and the one that rarely appears is hamzah. While the output will be different for each juz, both information and graphic visualization results.

Keywords: Al-quran, text mining, R shiny
